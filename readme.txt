My invoicing system written in Python against Google App Engine and the Google Calendar API. 

This is a learning project for me, and it's not complete, though it is close to useable. It was developed with a "mobile-first" mindset, but it doesn't rely on gestures and thus no framework dependency other than basic jQuery.
