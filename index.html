        <p>This is a learning project for me, it's not complete, and isn't really useable as-is just yet. It is being written to scratch an itch and provide myself with a simple web-based invoicing system that logs time and creates invoices from it. While the system is quite flexible with minor tweaking, it is focussed on the single-person freelancer workflow/usecase. It uses jQuery Mobile for styling and interaction.</p>
