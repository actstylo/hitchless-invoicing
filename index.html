          <h2>Google Apps <small>for your domain</small></h2>
        	<p>Tie this app into your domain, as controlled by <a href="http://google.com/a">GAfyd</a>, and authentic using your account. Or just use your own Google account.</p>

          <h2>Google App Engine</h2>
          <p>Ironically, this app isn't meant to be run from a single App Engine instance. Download my code, update the configuration, and deploy to your own private AppEngine silo.</p>

          <h2>Google Calendar</h2>
          <p>Log your time within the system, but simultaneously to Google Calendar as a backup, etc. It's optional, so you don't have to, but it's a nicety.</p>


          <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
           <p>I'm writing this app to be managed via a smart phone or tablet. It uses <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> framework for interaction. It's still very usable on the desktop, but that's just a side-effect.</p>

        
        	<h2>The Code</h2>
        	<p>It uses the WebApp framework included with GAE, and that utilizes django template syntax. jQuery Mobile runs the styling &amp; interaction scene.</p>

	  		<h2>The General Idea</h2>
	  		<ul>
	  			<li>You have YourDomain.com, and <a href="http://google.com/a">Google Apps for Your Domain</a> setup for it.</li>
	  			<li>You visit <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Google AppEngine</a> and create a new app called "YourInvoicing.appspot.com"</li>
	  			<li>You <a href="http://github.com/allankh/hitchless-invoicing">clone the guthub repo</a> to your local computer.</li>
	  			<li>Duplicate settings.example file into settings.py and edit it to your liking.</li>
	  			<li>Fire up the AppEngineLauncher, point it towards the app, and deploy to <strong>yourinvoicing.appspot.com</strong></li>
	  			<li>Visit your GAfYD control panel and add the appspot app there.</li>
	  			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob's_your_uncle">Bob's your uncle!</a> (I actually had an Uncle Bob for a while).</li>
	  		</ul>

      		<h2>Learning Project</h2>
      		<p><a href="http://allankenneth.com">I wrote this code</a> in order to teach myself some Python. I wanted to build something for Google App Engine. It's a make-work project that I am going to use, but make available to anyone who wants to try it out. The is provided as-is, and I probably won't do much free support.</p>
